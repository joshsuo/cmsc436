# Milestone 

## Proposed Milestone 3 Goals
Our main goal for Milestone 3 was to set up the camera and notification functionality
- Cameras functionality (every photo taken for a task should remove the taks from the calendar view)
- Notification functionality (high priority todos should notify the user multiple times a day)
- Finishing ToDo functionality by adding priority levels indicated by the UI and sorting todos as well as adding custom dates todos and repeatable todos



## Actual Accomplishments
- Camera functionality: camera opens and the photo in stored in the emulator. And, a photo being taken removes the task
- To-Do's: To-dos can be customized with different priotiy levels, and frequencies. Additioanlly, Todos can be deleted.

## Changes to Timeline
While we have completed the initial camera functionality , we have decided to allocate additional time for refining the camera functionality and having the stored images show up in the gallery. Additionally, we still need to add the nofication logic and determine what is best for different priority levels and if it needs be be added to the add todo popup. The revised plan is as above and will be complered by  April 19th.


## Challenges Faced
- Creating an intutitive UI around the camera and the functionality around it was difficult. Additioanlly, we kept facing emulator issues.
- With the camera, determining if the todo should gray out or not was a difficult design decision.

## Lessons Learned
-  we added more features like the camera and customizable to-dos, having a modular codebase made it easier to manage changes without breaking existing functionality
- some features depend on others  being fully implemented first. This taught us to better sequence our tasks and leave buffer time for integration

For the final deadline, our main focus will be on completing album and camera functionality and integrating it with the gallery as well as adding the notification logic and a strech goal
