# Milestone 2

## Proposed Milestone 1 Goals
Our main goal for Milestone 2 was to set up the todo functionality. Specifically, we aimed to:
- ToDo functionality (ability to add todos with all necessary information)
- Organization of todos in the day/week/month view (also ability to sort by time or priority)



## Actual Accomplishments
- To-Do button: Dynamic todo button that adds todo's for a specific date
- To-Do's in calendars: To-dos are stored and added to the calender view

## Changes to Timeline
While we have completed the initial todo functionality , we have decided to allocate additional time in the next milestone for refining the To-Do functionality and adding the abiltiy to sort by time and priority. The revised plan is as follows and will be complered by  April 10th:
- **Milestone 2:**
  - Implement full To-Do functionality (setting reminders, set priority, sort priority).

## Challenges Faced
- Adding text fields to a new view while keeping the background view was challenging
- Having to generate new todos in the calendar view proved to be difficult due to the dynamic nature

## Lessons Learned
- Determining intutivie UI for the todo's was difficult sicne we tried many approaches before finding the current one
- dyanmic lists are difficult to use and classes should be flexible to add new fields

For the next milestone, our main focus will be on completing album and todo adding functionality and integrating it with the calendar.
