## App Description

This app will be a to-do list (reminder list) that, only when you take a picture of said to-do item, will it be marked as completed. Instead of the typical checkmark for to-do lists, the app will check the box off with the image the user takes. You can add to-do items to the app and when to send reminders. The app will use the phone's camera functionality to take pictures of their completed tasks, which will then show a completed task.

## Minimal Goals

Home Page:
 * Month: On click, drops down full month calendar, where each day is clickable
 * Week: Displays day of the week where on click, it will take you to the to do page for that day
 * Day (default): Displays the to-do list for the current selected day

ToDos:
Each ToDo has a box next to the event where on-click, if not already completed, will open the camera to take a picture that will take place of the box to check off that event.

Pages
 * To-do list (Home page)
 * Past Days: album of the images you took that day
 * Present-Future: editable to-do list
 * Specific day page:
   * Add/edit page for to-do item
   * Includes reminder settings

Functionality needed:
 * Add events to the list
 * Sort the list by time/day + priority rating
 * Camera button next to ToDo item
 * Open the camera to check off events
 * Reminder notifications 
 * Recurring notifications
 * Repeated notifications 


## Stretch Goals

 * Calendar where each day is clickable: a collage of the images of the events youâ€™ve checked off that day
 * Share your day with friends
 * Physical activity section: checks off events based on motion sensors that determine sufficient steps/jumping-jacks/etc.
 * Face Filters
