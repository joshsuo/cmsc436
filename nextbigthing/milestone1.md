# Milestone 1

## Proposed Milestone 1 Goals
Our main goal for Milestone 1 was to set up the UI and calendar foundations. Specifically, we aimed to:
- Implement a To-Do page with icons indicating that a picture needed to be taken and a list of tasks.
- Implement an Album page where all images are displayed and can be organized by a time period (day, week, month, etc.).
- Build the calendar structure, allowing tasks to be organized within different time periods (day, week, month).
- Ensure smooth navigation between pages.

## Actual Accomplishments
- To-Do Page: Implemented a minimal UI containing a list of tasks with an option to check them off and a camera icon indicating that a picture must be taken to mark a task as completed.
- Album Page: Designed an image grid format for storing completed task pictures, aligning with common photo album layouts across different devices. This feature will be iterated upon once we actually have the capability to add photos as currently there are blank tiles.
- Calendar: Integrated multiple packages to construct a functional calendar that organizes tasks by date and can be modified to display different time periods (day, week, month).
- Navigation: Established smooth transitions between the Home Page, To-Do List page, and Album page.

## Changes to Timeline
While we have completed the initial UI setup, we have decided to allocate additional time in the next milestone for refining the To-Do functionality and fully integrating it with the calendar. The revised plan is as follows and will be complered by March 28th:
- **Milestone 2:**
  - Implement full To-Do functionality (adding and editing tasks, setting reminders, marking tasks as completed with images).
  - Integrate the To-Do list with the calendar view.
  - Implement UI components for adding new tasks in the To-Do page.

## Challenges Faced
- Calendar Integration: Finding the right packages and configuring the calendar took longer than expected.
- UI Consistency: Ensuring a cohesive design across different pages required multiple iterations and adjustments.
- Navigation Complexity: Structuring navigation in a way that feels intuitive was initially very tricky

## Lessons Learned
- Breaking UI development into smaller tasks helps in managing complexity.
- Using third-party libraries can help reduce development time and reading their documention is beneficial to see how they can be used.
- Designing a clear navigation flow from the start minimizes extra work and ensures a better user experience.

For the next milestone, our main focus will be on completing To-Do functionality and integrating it with the calendar.
